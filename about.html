            <h2>Educational Background</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>My three year education in the university</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently a third-year student at Addis Ababa University (AAU), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
                     My time at AAU has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of key concepts in software development and computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my studies, I have engaged in a variety of relevant courses that have provided me with a solid foundation in the field.
                     These courses include Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Management Systems, and several programming languages, notably Python and Java. 
                     Currently, I am expanding my knowledge through a course in Web Development, which is enhancing my skills in creating responsive and interactive web applications.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to my coursework, I have had the opportunity to work on several practical projects that have reinforced 
                    my learning and allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios. 
                    Some of my notable projects include:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Currency Converter: A Python application that converts various currencies using real-time exchange rates.</li>
                    <li>Dormitory Database System: A management system designed to track dormitory resources and efficiently manage resident information.</li>
                    <li>Library Catalog App: An application that helps manage library resources, enabling users to search for and borrow books easily.</li>
                    
                </ul>
        
                <p>Through these projects, I have developed strong technical skills and a passion for software development. My programming expertise includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                </ul>
        
                <P>As I continue my studies, I am excited to further develop my skills and work on more complex projects that contribute to my growth as a software engineer.</P>
